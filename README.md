## About

I like to make music, and I like to write code, so I desided to learn all the things I need to create musical applications in the web.

This website is a collection of my experiments, and a way to share my knowledge with the world.

It's kind of a mishmash between a blog, docs, and demos, but at the core it's a learning tool for dealing with music in the web.
