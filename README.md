## About

I like to make music, and I like to write code, so I desided to learn all the things I need to create musical applications in the web.

This website is a collection of my experiments, and a way to share my knowledge with the world.

It's kind of a mishmash between a blog, docs, and demos, but at the core it's a learning tool for dealing with music in the web.

## How to use this website

Basically, the main page a collection of links to different tutorials, demos and docs.

Each square is a link. Click on them to open a modal that describes the content, and then click on the enterence button to enter the page.

Also, you can mark the page as read, in progress, not relevant, or not started which is the default state.
